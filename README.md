# Godot 3.1 Dissolve shader with OpenSimplexNoise


Simple tutorial-like Dissolve Shader and Material for GODOT 3.1 alpha 2

![in_action](in_action.gif "in action")

The Hearth of project is simple [Dissolve Shader](Materials/Dissolve.shader) with 4 uniforms:

```shader
shader_type canvas_item;

//  noise texture (see Dissolve.material for GUI Generated one or Main.gd::_on_reseed_noise_pressed() for scripted one)
uniform sampler2D noise_tex : hint_albedo;
// burn ramp (gradiant from some color to transparent) - see Dissolve.material for GUI generated one
uniform sampler2D burn_ramp : hint_albedo;
// size of burning path (0 is infinitely short)
uniform float burn_size : hint_range(0.1, 1);

// position (time) of burning
uniform float burn_position : hint_range(-1, 1);

void fragment()
{
	// get texture pixel color * tint
	// thats our result without burning effect.
	// We use COLOR as final color (we can use variable and assign it to COLOR at the end, but there is no reason to care)
	// TEXTURE is Sprite.Texture from GODOT
	// UV is UV from GODOT
	// At first, COLOR is filled with tint (Sprite -> Modulate) from GODOT (and from vertex shader).
	COLOR = texture(TEXTURE, UV) * COLOR;
	
	// get some noise minus our position in time (thats why burn_position is range(-1, 1))
	float test = texture(noise_tex, UV).r - burn_position;
	
	// if our noise is bigger then treshold
	if (test < burn_size) {
	
		// get burn color from ramp
		vec4 burn = texture(burn_ramp, vec2(test * (1f / burn_size), 0));

		// override result rgb color with burn rgb color (NOT alpha!)
		COLOR.rgb = burn.rgb;
		
		// and set alpha to lower one from texture or burn.
		// that means we keep transparent sprite (COLOR.a is lower) and transparent 'burned pathes' (burn.a is lower)
		COLOR.a = min(burn.a, COLOR.a);
	}
}
```

Noise texture can be generated with script:

```
var noise = OpenSimplexNoise.new();
noise.seed = randi();
# noise.octaves = 3;
# noise.period = 64;
# noise.persistence = 0.5;
# noise.lacunarity = 2;

var noise_tex = NoiseTexture.new();

noise_tex.width = 512; # width of sprite
noise_tex.height = 256; #height of sprite
noise_tex.noise = noise;

_material.set_shader_param("noise_tex", noise_tex);
```

or in GUI:
